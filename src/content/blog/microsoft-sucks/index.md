**This is my first hit piece!** Please forgive any deficiencies in my writing, and have mercy, for I have been faced with the unfortunate crisis of wishing I had tried a bit harder in English class.

This article is a record of the many mind-bending bugs, glitches, UX nightmares and general shittiness
that I have encountered in my forced interactions with Microsoft products, alongside some broad history on
just what might have made these products so bad to begin with.

## Well-trodden paths
No modern man's technical thinkpiece can go without mention of all-encompassing [enshittification](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-26/macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2024/104648884).
I don't need to explain it here, but what I do want to mention, or rather commend, is Microsoft's incredible
dedication to the bit and their industry leading efforts to inspire hatred, anger and rage in any poor soul
unfortunate enough to touch one of their products.

Their history of abhorrent behaviour is long-running and broad, with a flavourful mix of ethical failures,
monopolistic practices and mistreatment of their workers. Oh, lookie, is that a
[locked down bootloader](https://web.archive.org/web/20120725002533/http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/09/windows-8-secure-boot-sparks-linux-furor-and-a-microsoft-response)
to test the waters of vendor-locked PC hardware? (More on that later)! How about the continued usage of the most
H1-B visas in the USA? And who could forget the [Halloween documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents),
as over-explored a topic as that is?

The kicker is, you don't really need to know any of that to feel the rot at the core of the company -- the
software speaks for itself.

## Microsoft Word
Word is the worst text editor I've ever used, bar none. How it manages to fail to this extent is beyond me.
- Review mode is beyond broken. Not only is it impossible to figure out how to track changes one by one to
actually see what's going on, it breaks editing UX in such a fundamental way that I loathe having to use it
for work-related change tracking.
- The online version of Word frequently eats characters as I type, and then re-eats the same character when
I try to type it in again.
- When it's done eating enough characters to sate its hunger, it turns bulimic and vomits out a paragraph
of gibberish formed from repeated snippets of whatever I just typed.
- The offline version is more stable, but it doesn't let me export to PDF without first signing in to Adobe,
a partnership that I shall interpret as the work of the devil.
- Images and shapes do not perfectly align between local and online versions of Word -- where by "perfectly
align" I in fact mean even come close to looking the same. I don't blame the Microsoft developers for this,
since I think I would have trouble comparing things if I was blind, which most of the Word team must be.
- Image dimensions and table layouts apparently have some magical quality that makes them an untrackable
change, which you are reminded about upon every single image resize.
