**ROUGH**:
- Due to overly optimistic promises of the past, hype around the learn-to-code movement, and the prevalence of generative AI, students have a rough time with introductory programming courses and the technical culture of software.
- There is an overall low level of motivation, be that due to AI, university, or the current generation of students.
- Blame the CEOs - personal responsibility is difficult in a world with no positive examples, and the most powerful people

**DISCLAIMER:** I've collected the opinions shared in this article over a few years of casual teaching and even more casual observation at a number of university Computer Science courses. Nothing is based on hard data, but rather on conversations, overheard statistics, and vibes. Also, I'm from Australia, and go to university in Australia, so please *carefully* extrapolate to your own country if you want to make any hot takes.

Some background: I was brought on to teach a first year course when I myself entered into second year as part of a lax and freeform student mentor program. I lucked out -- I was picked for my performance in that same course, which had been structured in the exact right way to encourage me to fight my astounding laziness and perform at my best, and thus stand out enough to be hired.
It also made for a pivotal point in my career as a programmer, as I had to know my shit -- said "shit" being assembly, algorithms, and memory management, which I firmly believe are a must for any self-respecting engineer.

One particular side effect of this gig was that as a teacher, I was of the same age as a majority of the students I taught. I've had many good friendships and technical collaborations as a result, witnessed the birth and horror of ChatGPT in education first-hand, and like to think that I've gained some mildly interesting insight from my peers, which I share with you today.

## The Distribution
Without further ado -- the bell curve of compsci students, as derived from my vibes-based observations, is as follows:

<BellCurve/>

Looks a bit grim, doesn't it? Australian university students <Link href="https://www.education.gov.au/higher-education-statistics/student-data/selected-higher-education-statistics-2023-student-data/key-findings-2023-student-data">drop out at a rate of about 20%</Link>, which means that most of this tragic bell curve (surprisingly) ends up with a degree. That doesn't reveal whether or not the students represented in the unfavourable sections gain employment, which they very well might not considering the barely-recovering job market right now (may it be cursed for eighteen generations).
