Recently, I read a fantastic article called
[the Era of the Business Idiot](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-era-of-the-business-idiot/).
It's an evocative read, and one that paints a stark picture of today's
tech industry at a time when it is most prescient. I strongly recommend you give it a read, as it
will provide context to much of what I want to talk about in this piece. 

Since it is quite long, I can give a quick summary.

The author, Ed Zitron, posits that the blame for many of our recent woes, (both as inhabitants of
the tech world and as members of a semi-functional society), lies at the feet of the managerial class[^1] abusing their
positions of power to claw their way ahead, with only a dim awareness of the consequences.

> "We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when 'being good at stuff' matters far less than the
appearance of doing stuff, where 'what's useful' is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can
measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire
careers to escape the world of work."

Traditional business values be damned, the modern executive must look good and put the
least amount of effort into doing so. They exist to rise through the ranks at breakneck pace, masking
any incompetency behind the mass of bureaucracy endemic to any large company or organisation (such as
the government, or Microsoft). This vapid goal-oriented mindset has infected education and culture,
and every level of management from the humble product lead to CEO. As Ed puts it, "our economy is
run by people that don't participate in it", and as a result, everything SUCKS.

I broadly agree with the conclusions drawn, and thoroughly appreciate his lambasting of libertarian thinking.
However, one particular bit of framing stuck out to me as odd.

Ed portrays the modern manager as some kind of unthinking machine that turns consumer goodwill into
undeservingly green pips on a stock graph, as if that is an inevitable
result of their time on the MBA conveyor belt. I understand his distaste for and use of this paricular
archetype, since he is a long-time warrior against the power structures that perpetuate the current
economic status quo. However, such a framing feels incomplete to me.
After all, even C-level executives are more-or-less human, (as replaceable by ChatGPT as they may be).
Occam's razor generously implies that everyone is just trying to
do right by themselves, even if that "right" involves making your company logo into bold Helvetica and 
losing $100M in value. Intuitively, there must be a stronger cause for this kind of behaviour than the 3
years they spent studying business at Stanford and their apparently inborn "allegiance to shareholder value".

With the above in mind, in this article I plan to commit the ultimate sin -- taking a humanist approach
to exploring the mind of a CEO. Who knows what nuggets of wisdom I can extract from these sinister depths?
Mind you, I don't plan on being particularly charitable, nor do I at all claim that the people mentioned
below are worth your respect[^2]. I just think that the same drive that leads an executive to push
for a business-wide Microsoft 365 subscription *\*shudder\** can be used in one's everyday work life
to great benefit -- all without having to forgo your soul to the devil.

## The ego drive

So, what drives the modern manager? My broad thesis is that people like Elon Musk or your local product lead
are, at their core, **degenerate gamblers**, whose luck is invariably incredible -- which is
why they continue to stake more and more on their own success. The currencies they choose to gamble in are:
- **A:** The public's trust and respect, where the public is anyone affected by their work.
- **B:** Their own self worth.

These two elements, external and internal, form their aggregate **ego**[^3]. Their leadership
position and the 'outputs' of their work are inherently tied to their sense of self, which hence
become a matter of life or death for their squishy and self-conscious minds. The same way that the
public forms a logical connection between a company and its management, the management forms an
emotional connection between the company and themselves, 
propotional to the share of their livelihood that they've invested in it. Selling bullshit becomes
a stake in a poker-reminiscent game of social currency, green pips or successful projects turn into
respect and power, and jackpot begets further success, with a load of dopamine to boot.

You don't have to be at the peak of the pyramid; every self-important LinkedIn turbo-poster
from Microsoft or OpenAI fits this archetype. Their motivations are likely more internal, and
their 'public' limited to other LinkedIn turbo-posters, all of them writing the same spiel
about how AI tooling won't ever work for you until you accept it lovingly into the very core of your soul.

Middle managers will fight tooth and nail to look good and earn a promotion they don't deserve, only to
do it over and over again, with more of themselves hanging on the line each time. By the end, you
can't help but question how they got so far with the sheer incompetency and emotionality
that they frequently display.

The root cause is the same for both. They have chosen a role, a vision that they must believe in until the end,
because they have a personal stake on its success, and a slippery slope down the hole of overcommitment
awaiting them if they fail. Success begets a bigger gamble, familiarity breeds contempt, and the hedonic
treadmill keeps rolling, et cetera. Nothing particularly unusual for our unfortunate species.

Upon taking this framing, it follows that juicing a valuation or lying to promote growth are just a
manifestation of this egotistical phenomenon of the modern manager wanting to prove themselves as the Man
with the Big Britches over and over again, influenced upon them by the hours upon hours they spent writing out 
"SHAREHOLDER VALUE = GOOD" on a business school whiteboard.

As an example, and now referring specifically to CEOs that choose to emerge as public figures for the benefit of their
business -- there is no one more invested in themselves, and their company as an extension of themselves,
than people like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, SBF, Adam Neumann, Elizabeth Holmes. Each
has committed quite hard to the bit, and they express their dedication in childish, often pathetic and
obvious means.

Elon Musk is the perfect example of this phenomenon. He has linked himself so intrinsically to his
companies, and his personality to their success, that the Tesla board is offering a
[trillion-dollar pay package](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-06/elon-musk-1-trillion-tesla-payment-package-explained/105743354)
for him to lock the fuck in and actually focus his efforts on the company, as they see no other path to
the same level of growth.
That's even ignoring the many, many cases of him using the success of Tesla or his other companies to
boost public perception of his own abilities, such as the infamous "I know more about manufacturing than anyone
currently alive on earth".

Sam Altman maintains the image of a hip youngster, tweeting like a 13-year-old girl and throwing
very in-character ['my company can beat up your company'](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-sam-altman-throws-shade-google-aesthetic-2024-5)
style pot-shots at the competition, while spewing long-winded scare-mongering AI science-fiction
with the very real risk of sounding insane
(though many will only see this in hindsight), all of it part of an effort to juice investment in OpenAI
through manipulation of its (and his own) public image.

Mark Zuckerberg, upon realising that looking like a lizard-alien-robot in every congressional hearing
is unlikely to drive customer success for Facebook, rebranded into a hip Zillenial, performing an
infamous stunt where he rode a surfboard with a beer in one hand and American flag in the other.
It's so obviously a PR manouever to rehabilitate his image because of its proximity to Facebook's other
rebrand (to Meta), and just that it's *way too fucking cool* for anything he'd think of doing on his
own. Thank you, Andrew Tate, for giving men everywhere the courage to save their manliness and their
company.

Elizabeth Holmes, outside of the very obvious fraud, deepened her voice into a poor imitation of a 
frat bro while dressed like Temu Steve Jobs to add an aura of "seriousness" to Theranos, helping sell the lie.
SBF was somehow successful in giving off the impresion of a genius by playing Bronze-level League of Legends
during investor meetings. Adam Neumann was successful in selling the internet's biggest pay-piggy,
Masayoshi Son, on the failed business WeWork by doing large amounts of drugs, walking barefoot, and
then describing his vision of a loneliness-curing utopia constructed entirely out of beer-on-tap office
real-estate.

## What are they doing *right*?


## Ego and Software
Coming soon.........

[^1]: I use the terms manager, executive and CEO interchangeably (for dramatic effect) -- management is management.

[^2]: Forgive me for my broad usage of the term. I don't have the saintly patience required for
philosophical accuracy.

[^3]: For many of them, I would propose that they are deserving of your utmost disrespect.

## DRAFT AREA - DONT READ PAST HERE
There are many other terms for the same concept (cult of personality, selling vibes, etc.) but none
of them are as generally applicable; even a middle manager has plenty of ego to bet on some
silly project or other. Even you have this type of ego, and I would like to draw some equivalencies

- Introspecting - what is the drive
- what leads founders and public figures to sell bs


There is a singular and ultimate secret to getting thick wads of cash in the
modern tech economy, and one that does not bode well for its health. That secret
-- one's ability to sell convincing drivel to clueless simpletons for the
longest possible time. The masters of the craft are many: Elon Musk,
[Sam Altman](https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/), and
[Mark Zuckerberg](https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/)
among the most known, with a few big-time fraudsters like
[SBF](https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-league-of-legends-investor-pitch-meeting-2022-11),
[Elizabeth Holmes](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/management/elizabeth-holmes-may-be-a-fraud-but-she-knows-leadership-psychology-20220112-p59nm3),
and Adam Neumann pulling up the rear.

The difference between the former and the latter is stark -- Musk, Altman and
Zuckerberg are responsible billionaire CEOs that bring Real Value to society
(shareholders), while SBF, Holmes and Neumann are a bunch of crooks that
defrauded honest, working people (i.e. the CEO of SoftBank)...

...or maybe they are all the same, and any of them at any point are capable of
equal levels of egotistical stupidity.

The actual difference between the two groups is very simply put: for our hapless
miscreants, their respective companies did not outlast their ego. Which, in a
roundabout way, brings me to the thesis I would like to share with you:

> Ego is only bad if you're wrong.
>
> - Me, when I'm right

I don't refer to the concept of _wrong_ in any platonic or factual sense, but
rather as judged by the court of public opinion -- whether that public be all
the people that you just sold on your fictional blood-testing technology, or the
guy sitting next to you at work.

I would also strongly advise against sticking to this philosophy in your
personal life[link here]() -- but, when applied to the goal-driven professional
world, there is much greater nuance. In fact, I believe this concept of
unpunished ego is relevant to most work, despite my framing of these views
through my familiar lens of software engineering; so, extrapolate as you wish.

Without further ado...

## The Ego Economy

Let's start off with a videogame-y analogy.

In software, and more broadly in tech, standing out involves facets of engineer
swag, confidence, and -- most importantly -- a strong personal mythos. Being
unapologetically bold more often than not is a recipe for the worldwide
adoration of every different kind of nerd, so long as you have enough social
funds to back some of your bark with a little bit of bite.

With that context in mind, I would posit that what happens for those
investor-poaching CEOs is the same thing that happens to you when you boldly
declare that memory safety is Extremely Important, or that user data shouldn't
be stored in an Excel sheet and the whole thing needs to be nuked probably, or
when you push back on "vibe coding" in a project; that is, a number of...let's
call them Ego Points (EPs), are staked in a poker-reminiscent game of social
trust and willpower, in the hopes of rising up in the ranks of the Ego Economy.

Some of these bets are cheap, like coming to the doorstep of world's biggest
pay-piggy, Masayoshi Son, and pitching him your Revolutionary New Business.
Other bets are expensive, like running a cryptocurrency exchange and making all
your investment decisions in an orgy-fueled haze
[citation needed but is it really?](), or worse, while
[ranked Bronze II in League of Legends](https://kotaku.com/sbf-ftx-crypto-scam-league-legends-bronze-rank-vayne-1849782021).

If success is achieved, there's a big payout. If not, your EPs go down the
drain. In many cases, the EPs are leveraged to the tits, and if you go into
overdraw you might end up having to pull from the jail time pile (like SBF or
Holmes), or for us normal people, lose the trust of others. You also don't have
to bet big -- the world of the layman contains a multitude of opportunities to
stake your EPs both in ways that matter and ways that don't.

More EPs == more clout. You spend them when you share nitpicky opinions, apply
to jobs, or boldly push for a certain way of doing things (more on this later).

But, you might say, "isn't this just _society_?!" To you I say shh! I'm not
taking questions right now...but I was going to talk about it anyway, so might
as well answer.

## Software and Ego

The way I see it, modern software is (unfortunately) largely unconstrained by
the reality of physical things[link here]. Sure, there are many quantifiable
measures of quality, like performance or code coverage, but even they become
relative, or even subjective, when viewed from the perspective of what is to be
achieved and in what timeframe.

For a developer, there are ten bazillion ways to do the same exact thing with
wildly varying outcomes, which underlines with a thick stroke the importance of
good judgement -- and even better taste. Writing software can be likened to
writing fiction, wherein you stake your name on the quality of your personally
distinct outputs. Being opinionated is _good_ and even _moral_. You make a name
for yourself as a Serious Engineer to gain the freedom to make good decisions,
or you end up layers deep in a hell of your own partial creation, debugging a
five-level-inheritance JSON parser in C++, when the wise choice is to throw the
whole thing out, and you really should have pushed for it at the earliest
opportunity.

In the workplace, what underlies your insistence that \*crappy old language\* is
Bad and \*shiny new language\* is Good is not only the technical theory behind
your claims, but the bold implication that _you are right_, and that the
tradeoffs are worth it, and that you know what you are doing. This mirrors the
Big Boy decisions made by the colourful cast of characters I mentioned in the
introduction, only that they operate on grander scales. Instead of staking their
ego on their technical expertise, they stake it on their Hot Air&trade; Business
and promise that everyone will be huffing Hot Air&trade; by next year which will
lead to returns so big that they will (using Hot Air&trade;) blow the socks off
any Saudi prince that dares invest. The principle remains the same -- the law of
the land is driven by ego.

## The Takeaway

But you don't want to sell Hot Air&trade;, do you? That would make you akin to
the top brass of a bloated consultancy, and any self-respecting engineer would
rather set themselves on fire...using Hot Air&trade;.
