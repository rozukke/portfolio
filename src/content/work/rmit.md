Hired to help teach several C++ classes as a tutor. The classes had a focus on low-level concepts,
assembly, and algorithm design. I was eventually brought on to develop and maintain an API for the
students to use in the class, along with various other bits of software. Eventually, was the most
experienced tutor for that set of classes. Stopped teaching after starting full-time position.
